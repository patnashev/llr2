DEPRECATED: The source code is no longer maintained and no further releases are planned. Replaced by [PRST](https://github.com/patnashev/prst) utility.

LLR2 is a primality testing program for numbers of several specific forms. It uses Gwnum library by George Woltman, original LLR code by Jean Penn√©, hardware error check by Robert Gerbicz and test verification scheme by Pavel Atnashev with verifiable delay function by Krzysztof Pietrzak.

Main differences from the original LLR:
- Gerbicz check in Proth test.
- Gerbicz check in Fermat PRP test for b=2.
- Gerbicz check in Fermat PRP test for b!=2 using Sliding Window exponentiation method (limits performance penalty to 15-20%).
- Native APRCL test (no need to link additional libraries or have satellite programs).
- [Proth/PRP test verification scheme](https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=25323) with certification and certificate validation (fast double-check).
- [Pietrzak VDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/627.pdf) for more efficient test verification (saves on bandwidth).
- Updated checkpoint file format with test fingerprint.
- Checkpoint write through file cache (on Windows).
- Minor changes and fixes.
